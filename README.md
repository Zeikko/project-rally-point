# Rally Point

Rally Point is a project name for a service that aims to make it simple and fast to organize and play high quality games in [Squad](https://joinsquad.com/).

## How is it going to work?

The aim is to build a web application where the user can do the following

- Log in using Steam single sign on
- Join into a queue and see who and how many players are in the queue and are needed for a new game start
- When the queue is full all players will get a sound notification and a 30 second timer to press a button to confirm that they will be playing
- Once all players have pressed the button the players start to vote for the team leaders
- 2 players with the most votes will be assigned to be team leader
- Team leaders will then pick squad leaders from the player pool and also act as a squad leader themselves
- Squad leaders will pick players to their teams. Each team has a turn to pick where each squad leader picks players simultaneously
- Once all players have been picked into teams the game starts and the players are given a link to join into the game

This is just a first idea and may change at any time

## Why do all this?

- Easier to organize than clan matches
- No need to have a teamful friends to play with
- Players will learn a lot by playing with new people
- Players are committed to play a full match
- Players who find and use this web application will be more skilled players in average
- Teams will be more balanced and result in tighter matchups

## How will this be done?

I am not completely sure of the details yet
I was thinking of developing this as an open source project in GitHub
I was also thinking of using the following tech

- node.js
- React
- Parcel
- socket.io
- PostgreSQL

This is of course a subject to change also
